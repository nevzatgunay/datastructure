it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the
impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the
truth. now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down,
so there only remained your niece and the maids. but if it were
the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in
their place?      there could be no possible reason.
